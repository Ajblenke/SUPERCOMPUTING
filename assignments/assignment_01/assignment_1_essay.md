## Motivation for Learning High-Performance Computing

My name is Joseph Blenke, and I am currently a Junior majoring in Data Science with a
concentration in Spatial Data Analytics. I'm taking this class because as I am interested
in how supercomputing is utilized in AI and want to develop the skills necessary in how to utilize them. I think this is a skill that will become increasingly more valuable with the rise of AI but also align with my interests. I have been wanting to make the switch to linux for a while and I was finally given a reason to download it. I knew that that would be a learning curve but I was ready for it. This class was exactly what I was looking for because I have always been learning in my own time. I have already been using what we have been learning in general. It has made me more conscious of how much more efficiently I can use my workspace as well as accommodate it for my preferences. 

## Goals for This Course

My primary goal is to develop a solid understanding in how HPC’s are able to function and to be able to use them to my advantage. With linux being the primary operating system for HPC's, developing muscle memory is truly my goal. By having a class where I am also learning new techniques and developing my abilities in linux it will make me also develop a baseline for what I should know. My major concentration is in spatial analytics and I know how large raster datasets can be. These skills will be directly applicable when working with large geospatial datasets, running spatial simulations, or training models on high-resolution imagery.

## Plan of Attack

I have already taken the first step by installing Linux on my personal machines. I recently set up both Ubuntu and CachyOS, and I'm making myself use the terminal for everyday tasks. Throughout the semester, I want to treat each assignment as a chance to dig deeper into the underlying concepts rather than just checking boxes. I've started documenting my learning process, taking notes on new commands, and experimenting with things beyond what's strictly required. When I hit something I don't understand, I'll look for additional resources like official documentation or forums to fill in the gaps.



## Folder Structure and Reproducible Research

The folder structure I created for this assignment is designed around treating data as read-only. My `data/` directory is split into `raw/` and `clean/` subdirectories so that original data never gets modified. This way I can always trace my analysis back to its source and rerun everything

The `scripts/` folder keeps all my code in one place, which makes version control straightforward. The `results/` directory gives output files a clear home, separate from both input data and source code. This prevents the problem of mixing generated files with original files, which can get confusing fast.

The `docs/`, `config/`, and `logs/` directories complete the structure by providing dedicated spaces for documentation, configuration parameters, and execution records. This organization means that anyone, including my future self, can look at the project and understand the workflow from start to finish. They can see what data went in, what code was run, what parameters were used, and what results came out.

## Why Documented Code Matters

In computational research, code is methodology. Just as a laboratory scientist must document their experimental procedures in enough detail for others to replicate the work,
computational researchers must document their code. Without documentation, even correct results become unverifiable and therefore untrustworthy from a scientific standpoint.

Documentation serves multiple purposes. It helps collaborators understand what the code does and why certain decisions were made. It helps reviewers verify that the methodology is sound. Most importantly, it helps the original author, who will inevitably forget the details of their own code given enough time. Writing clear comments and maintaining README files is an essential part of the research process. Documented code transforms a one-time analysis into a foundation that others can verify, critique, and build upon.

## About Me

Beyond this course, I love to play football (soccer), play video games, eat good food and travel. My family is in the foreign service so I grew up all around the world (7 counties total) which also plays a part in my interest in global affairs. That background also shapes why I'm drawn to spatial data analytics. I've always thought about the world in terms of places and how they connect to each other.

I hope this course helps me understand more of what's happening behind the scenes, the infrastructure and computation that power the tools and systems people interact with every day without really thinking about it.
